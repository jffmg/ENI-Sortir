ENI-Sortir is a group project by 3 students for the DWWM training programme at ENI Ecole informatique.

This was the second project from 2 scheduled for the training programme. We had begun the programme in November 2020 and this project took place in April 2021.
We had 10 days to build a fictitious website with the Symfony framework: a platform for ENi students to offer in-person events. The goal was to deliver not a finished product, but a basic website with a number of working functionalities:
- signing up to user account
- displaying and updating user profile (eg. upload profile picture)
- creating and publishing events, updating, cancelling them
- displaying list of events: open, closed, cancelled, ongoing, etc.
- filtering and sorting events listed: location, date, organizer etc.
- signing up for events and withdrawing
- events management: number of attendees, event status, etc.
- automated database update
- admin functions: deactivating user, adding users via csv file, managing locations and events
- e-mail notification for forgotten password

We had some additional constraints:
- MVC pattern
- handmade custom responsive CSS (no Bootstrap, no CSS preprocessor)
- languages: PHP with Symfony (ORM: Doctrine), MySQL; Ajax to display some forms
